            <h1>Blueprint GTM Playbook for Blinq</h1>

            <h2>Who the Hell is Jordan Crawford?</h2>

            <p>Founder of Blueprint GTM. Built a business by scraping 25M+ job posts to find company pain points. Believes the Predictable Revenue model is dead. Thinks mounting an AI SDR on outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse—no one gets anywhere, and it still shits along the way.</p>

            <p>The core philosophy is simple: The message isn't the problem. The LIST is the message. When you know exactly who to target and why they need you right now, the message writes itself.</p>

        <!-- SECTION 2: The Old Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Old Way (What Everyone Does)</h2>

            <p>Let's be brutally honest about what your GTM team is doing right now. They're buying lists from ZoomInfo, adding some "personalization" like mentioning a LinkedIn post, then blasting generic messages about features. Here's what it actually looks like:</p>

            <div class="old-way-example">
                <p><strong>The Typical Blinq SDR Email:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: Quick Question about [Company Name]

Hi [First Name],

I noticed on LinkedIn that [Company Name] recently expanded your sales team. Congrats on the growth!

I wanted to reach out because we work with companies like Hilton and McKinsey to help sales teams share contact information more efficiently.

Blinq offers digital business cards that let you share your info via QR code, NFC, or Apple Wallet. We've helped companies save 50% on printing costs.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how we might be able to help [Company Name]?

Best,
Generic SDR</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The prospect is an expert. They've seen this template 1,000 times. "Companies like Hilton and McKinsey" doesn't prove you understand THEIR situation. It's interruption disguised as personalization. Delete.</p>

            <p>For horizontal products like Blinq, Blueprint GTM identifies <strong>situations where timing creates urgency</strong>. Instead of generic vertical pain, we find specific trigger events that make the product necessary RIGHT NOW.</p>

Your rebrand from [OldName] to [NewCo] was announced November 8th. Your team likely still has boxes of [OldName] cards—and reprinting 200+ employee cards takes 2-3 weeks plus $4-8 per person.

With digital cards, one admin update pushes the new brand to everyone's Apple Wallet instantly. No reprints, no obsolete inventory.

Saw [NewCo]'s rebrand announcement on [date]. Quick question: are you reprinting business cards for the whole team, or going digital?

Most companies discover mid-rebrand that printed cards create a 3-week delay between "new brand approved" and "cards in hands." Digital cards update in 60 seconds.

Your careers page shows 23 open client-facing roles (12 sales, 6 account management, 5 customer success). If even half fill in the next quarter, that's 12 new employees who need business cards before their first customer meeting.

I put together a quick ROI comparison: print cards at $6/person with 2-week lead time vs. digital at $4/person with instant provisioning. For a team scaling like yours, the time savings alone is worth a look.
