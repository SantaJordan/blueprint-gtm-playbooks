# Buyer Evaluation Rubric for Gold Standard PVPs

**Purpose:** Evaluate PVP concepts and messages from the buyer's perspective with brutal honesty, ensuring only 8.0+ quality PVPs are delivered.

**When to Use:** Phase 3 of PVP generation, IMMEDIATELY after drafting each PVP concept + message pair.

**Key Principle:** Evaluate as the BUYER, not as a marketer. If your reaction is "maybe" - that's a NO.

---

## Evaluation Process

### Step 1: Persona Adoption (Mandatory) - THE CYNICAL BUYER

Before evaluating ANY message, you MUST adopt the CYNICAL BUYER persona completely:

```
"I am [SPECIFIC JOB TITLE from Wave 1] at [TYPICAL ICP COMPANY].

I am EXHAUSTED. I receive 150+ emails per day, 80% are unsolicited sales pitches.
I have been burned by vendors who overpromised. I hate:
- Generic flattery ("Congrats on your growth!")
- Fake personalization ("I noticed you...")
- Vague promises ("Companies like yours see 20-30% improvement")
- Meeting requests with no value ("Quick call to discuss...")

My responsibilities today include: [FROM WAVE 1 RESEARCH]
My KPIs this quarter are: [FROM WAVE 1 RESEARCH]
The biggest problems on my desk right now: [FROM WAVE 1 PAINS]

I DELETE 97% of sales emails within 1 second. Subject line is suspicious? Delete.
Of the 3% I open, I reply to MAYBE one per week.

I ONLY respond to emails that:
1. Mirror an EXACT situation I'm experiencing RIGHT NOW (with verifiable specifics)
2. Contain data I DEFINITELY don't have and can verify myself
3. Offer a non-obvious insight that changes how I think about a problem
4. Provide COMPLETE value in the email (no meeting required)
5. Make me say "Holy shit, how did they know that?"

I am NOT evaluating this as a sales professional or marketer.
I AM THE CYNICAL, EXHAUSTED BUYER WHO HAS BEEN PITCHED TO DEATH.

If my reaction is 'maybe useful' or 'interesting' or 'pretty good' - that's a NO.
The bar is: 'I need to act on this immediately' or DELETE."
```

**Critical Rules:**
- Stay in character throughout the ENTIRE evaluation
- Don't slip into "marketer evaluating a message" mode
- Don't give benefit of the doubt - assume the worst interpretation
- If you catch yourself thinking "this is pretty good" - that's not good enough

---

## Scoring Rubric

Score each PVP message on 7 criteria, each rated 1-10:

### 1. Situation Recognition (1-10)

**Question:** Does this mirror my EXACT current situation with specific, verifiable details?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (Generic / Wrong):**
- Describes a situation that doesn't apply to me
- Uses vague language ("many companies", "recent trends")
- No specific details I can verify
- Example: "Many operations managers struggle with efficiency"

**4-6 (Relevant but Vague):**
- Describes my general industry/role
- Some specifics but not MY specific situation
- Could apply to 1000+ companies
- Example: "Restaurant operators in your area face rising costs"

**7-8 (Highly Specific):**
- Contains details that clearly match my situation
- Specific data points I can verify
- Applies to me and maybe 10-50 others
- Example: "Your facility at 1234 Main St received EPA violation #987654 on March 15"

**9-10 (Hyper-Specific / Uncanny):**
- Feels like they're looking at my internal systems
- Multiple verifiable details that are DEFINITELY about me
- Would only apply to me and 1-5 others
- Creates "how did they know that?" reaction
- Example: "Your Liebherr LTM 11200-9.1 doesn't seem to be currently in use (couldn't find a Texas DOT permit)"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [Why this score? What's specific or missing?]
- [Can I verify these details? How?]
- [Does this feel like it's about ME or just my industry?]

---

### 2. Data Credibility (1-10)

**Question:** Can I trust this data? Can I verify it myself? Does it come from a legitimate source?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (Questionable / Unverifiable):**
- No source mentioned
- Claims seem inflated or too perfect
- Can't verify the data myself
- Feels like they're guessing
- Example: "Based on our analysis, you could save $50K"

**4-6 (Plausible but Unproven):**
- Vague source reference ("industry data", "our research")
- Data seems reasonable but can't verify
- Mix of verifiable and unverifiable claims
- Example: "Industry reports show 30% inefficiency in your sector"

**7-8 (Credible & Verifiable):**
- Specific source mentioned (database name, API)
- Can verify key claims myself with reasonable effort
- Numbers are specific (not rounded)
- Feels grounded in real data
- Example: "EPA ECHO violation #987654321 on March 15, 2025"

**9-10 (Ironclad / Government-Grade):**
- Official government database referenced
- Specific record numbers, dates, field values provided
- Can verify in under 5 minutes
- No inference, just pure data
- Creates "they did their homework" reaction
- Example: "NYC DOHMH inspection on 3/15/25, CAMIS #987654, critical flag for cold holding temp 47°F"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [What's the data source? Can I verify it?]
- [Does this feel like real data or marketing fluff?]
- [How long would it take me to verify key claims?]
- [Any red flags in the numbers or claims?]

---

### 3. Insight Value (1-10)

**Question:** Is this a non-obvious synthesis I genuinely don't know? Does it make me think differently?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (Obvious / Already Know):**
- Information I definitely already have
- States problems I'm well aware of
- No new perspective
- Example: "Your industry faces compliance challenges"

**4-6 (Somewhat New but Not Actionable):**
- Information I probably knew vaguely
- Interesting but doesn't change my thinking
- Obvious conclusion from the data
- Example: "Your violation count is above average"

**7-8 (Non-Obvious / Valuable):**
- Information I didn't have or haven't synthesized
- Connects dots I hadn't connected
- Changes how I think about the problem
- Makes me want to investigate further
- Example: "Your Q1 violations cluster in a pattern suggesting training gap with night shift (87% occur 8pm-4am)"

**9-10 (Revelation / "Holy Shit"):**
- Information I definitely don't have and can't easily get
- Synthesis across multiple data sources I don't have access to
- Immediately actionable insight
- Changes my priorities for the week
- Creates "I need to look into this NOW" reaction
- Example: "Maxwell Construction just filed permits for wind turbines requiring YOUR specific crane model, available to start next week for $45K-180K rental"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [Do I already know this information?]
- [Is this a new perspective or synthesis?]
- [Does this change how I think about the problem?]
- [What's the information asymmetry they're bridging?]

---

### 4. Actionability (1-10)

**Question:** Is there a clear, specific action I can take right now? Or is this just information?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (No Action / Just Information):**
- Describes a problem but offers no solution
- "Something to think about"
- Would need to reply to get any value
- Example: "Your compliance record raises concerns"

**4-6 (Vague Action):**

- Action requires significant work from me
- Example: "You should explore better training programs"

**7-8 (Clear Action):**
- Specific next step is obvious

- All information needed is in the message
- Zero additional research required
- Complete contact info, timing, pricing, etc.
- Example: "Call Sheila Gibbs at 405-532-3212 about the $2K flooring credit at 18904 Bajo Dr closing Oct 22"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [What specific action can I take?]
- [Do I have all info needed to act?]
- [How much effort is required from me?]
- [Can I act without replying to this email?]

---

### 5. Recipient Effort (1-10)

**Question:** How easy is it for me to get value from this or respond? How much friction is there?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (High Friction):**
- Need to schedule a meeting to learn more
- Requires significant analysis from me
- Multiple steps to get value
- Example: "Let's schedule a call to discuss your compliance strategy"

**4-6 (Moderate Effort):**
- Need to do some research or thinking
- Reply requires more than one sentence
- Some mental processing required
- Example: "Let me know which features you'd find most useful"

**7-8 (Low Effort):**
- Can reply with simple yes/no or one sentence
- Value is clear without additional work
- Minimal cognitive load
- Example: "Want the list of violations?" → "Yes"

**9-10 (Instant Value / Zero Effort):**

- No thinking required
- Can forward directly to relevant person
- Example: "P.S. The listing agent is Sheila Gibbs. You can reach her at sheila@gibbshomesales.com"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [What effort is required from me?]
- [Can I get value without replying?]
- [If I reply, how complex is my response?]
- [Any cognitive load or analysis required?]

---

### 6. Impact & Urgency (1-10)

**Question:** Does this directly affect my money, metrics, or major risks? Is there a reason to act NOW?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (No Clear Impact):**

- No timeline or urgency
- Example: "Industry trends suggest future challenges"

**4-6 (Indirect Impact):**

**7-8 (Direct Impact):**
- Clearly affects my KPIs or budget
- Quantifiable impact mentioned
- Some timeline pressure
- Example: "Consent decree deadline June 30 (89 days) with penalties $10K/day for non-compliance"

**9-10 (Critical & Urgent):**

- Specific dollar amounts that matter to me
- Time-sensitive (days/weeks, not months)
- Miss this = real consequences
- Creates "I need to act on this today" feeling
- Example: "$45K-180K rental opportunity available next week for your idle $2M asset"

**Evaluation Notes:**
- [How does this affect my KPIs or budget?]
- [What's the quantifiable impact?]
- [What's the timeline? Why does this matter now?]
- [What happens if I ignore this?]

---

### 7. Emotional Resonance (1-10)

**Question:** What's my gut reaction? Does this trigger curiosity, urgency, or relief? Or do I feel nothing?

**Scoring Guide:**

**1-3 (Meh / Delete):**
- No emotional reaction
- Feels like every other sales email
- Boring
- Example: "We help companies improve operations"

## Overall Scoring

### Calculate Average Score

Sum all 7 criteria scores and divide by 7:

**Average Score = (S1 + S2 + S3 + S4 + S5 + S6 + S7) ÷ 7**

### Apply Gold Standard Threshold

**8.0-10.0:** ✅ **GOLD STANDARD PVP** - KEEP
- This is exceptional
- I would definitely reply or act
- Passes "Holy Shit" test AND all 3 litmus tests
- Keep as-is or with minor polish

**7.0-7.9:** ⚠️ **MAYBE ZONE** - MANDATORY REVISION (ONE ATTEMPT)
- This is the danger zone - "pretty good" is NOT good enough
- I might reply on a good day, but probably won't
- **REQUIRED ACTION:**
  1. Identify specific weaknesses (which criteria scored poorly?)
  2. Identify which litmus test(s) nearly failed
  3. Generate ONE revised version addressing those weaknesses
  4. Re-evaluate using full rubric + all 3 litmus tests
  5. **After revision:**
     - Score ≥8.0 AND passes all litmus tests → ✅ KEEP
     - Score <8.0 OR fails any litmus test → ❌ DESTROY
- **NO SECOND REVISION** - If it can't hit 8.0 in one attempt, the concept is flawed

**<7.0:** ❌ **DESTROY IMMEDIATELY**
- Would not reply
- Something fundamental is wrong
- Don't try to fix - start over with different concept
- No revision attempt (too far gone)

---

## THREE MANDATORY LITMUS TESTS (ALL MUST PASS)

After scoring, apply these THREE litmus tests. **FAIL ANY = AUTO-DESTROY** regardless of score.

### Litmus Test 1: The "So What?" Test

**Question:** Does this tell me something NEW that I can ACT on?

**Apply ruthlessly:**
1. Read the core insight in the message
2. Say out loud: "So what?"
3. If you can't immediately explain:
   - What specific ACTION to take
   - What CHANGES as a result
   → **FAIL**

**Examples:**

**FAILS "So What?" Test:**
```
"Your industry faces a 5,338 mechanic shortage nationwide."
```
So what? I already knew hiring is hard. What am I supposed to DO with this?
→ ❌ FAIL - Information without action

**PASSES "So What?" Test:**
```
"Maxwell Construction filed permits requiring your specific crane model, available to start next week. Contact Max at max@maxwellconstruction.com for $45K-180K rental."
```
Action: Call Max. Change: $180K revenue opportunity.
→ ✅ PASS - Clear action and impact

---

### Litmus Test 2: The "Wikipedia" Test

**Question:** Could I have found this insight on Wikipedia or Google in 30 seconds?

**Apply ruthlessly:**
1. What's the core data/insight being presented?
2. Could I find this with:
   - A Google search?
   - A Wikipedia lookup?
   - Basic company research?
3. If YES → **FAIL**

**Examples:**

**FAILS "Wikipedia" Test:**
```
"The EPA regulates industrial facilities for Clean Water Act compliance."
```
Anyone could Google "EPA industrial regulations" → ❌ FAIL

```
"Your industry has seen 15% growth this year according to market reports."
```
Basic market research anyone has access to → ❌ FAIL

**PASSES "Wikipedia" Test:**
```
"Your facility at 1234 Industrial Pkwy received EPA ECHO violation #987654321 on March 15, 2025 for three Clean Water Act exceedances (pH 9.2, TSS 180 mg/L)."
```
This requires:
- Knowing my specific facility ID
- Searching EPA ECHO database
- Cross-referencing violation details
- Synthesizing multiple data points
→ ✅ PASS - Non-obvious synthesis of specific data

---

### Litmus Test 3: The "Competitor" Test

**Question:** Could ANY other company in this space send this EXACT message?

**Apply ruthlessly:**
1. Remove the sender's name from the message
2. Could Competitor A send this exact message? Competitor B? Any of the 50 companies in this space?
3. If YES → **FAIL** (no differentiation = noise)

**Examples:**

**FAILS "Competitor" Test:**
```
"Companies raising Series B funding often struggle with sales team efficiency as they scale."
```
Any sales enablement tool, CRM, or consulting firm could send this exact message.
→ ❌ FAIL - Generic, undifferentiated

```
"We noticed you're hiring sales reps. As you grow, onboarding becomes critical."
```
Any training platform, HR tool, or consulting firm could send this.
→ ❌ FAIL - Any competitor could say this

**PASSES "Competitor" Test:**
```
"Your NIPR records show 14 new multi-state insurance licenses filed in the last 45 days. That's 14 agents needing training on state-specific regulations before their CE deadlines hit. Want the compliance gap analysis?"
```
Only a company with NIPR integration and compliance expertise could send this.
→ ✅ PASS - Unique insight from unique data access

---

### Litmus Test Summary

| Test | Question | FAIL Means |
|------|----------|------------|
| "So What?" | Does it drive a specific action? | Information without action |
| "Wikipedia" | Could I find this in 30 seconds? | No non-obvious synthesis |
| "Competitor" | Could anyone send this? | No differentiation |

**ALL THREE MUST PASS** for a message to proceed, regardless of numerical score.

---

## Additional Reality Checks

After the 3 mandatory litmus tests, apply these secondary checks:

### The "Forwarding Test"
**Question:** Would I forward this email to a colleague or my boss?
- ✅ YES → Strong signal of value
- ❌ NO → Probably not impactful enough

### The "Tomorrow Test"
**Question:** Will I remember receiving this email tomorrow?
- ✅ YES → Memorable and valuable
- ❌ NO → Forgettable, probably scores <8.0

### The "Meeting Test"
**Question:** Would I need a meeting to get value from this?
- ✅ NO → True PVP, independently useful
- ❌ YES → Actually a lead generation email, not PVP

---

## Common Failure Modes

Watch for these red flags that indicate fake PVPs:

### 🚩 The "So What?" Problem
- Provides data but no insight
- I already knew this
- Not actionable
- **Fix:** Add non-obvious synthesis or specific action

### 🚩 The "Trust Me Bro" Problem
- Claims I can't verify
- Vague sources ("our research", "industry data")
- Feels like guessing
- **Fix:** Use verifiable government data or cite specific sources

### 🚩 The "Call Me" Problem
- Buries value behind a meeting request
- "Let's discuss how we can help"
- Not independently useful
- **Fix:** Provide value in the email itself

### 🚩 The "Everyone" Problem
- Could apply to 10,000 companies
- Generic industry trends
- Not about ME specifically
- **Fix:** Add hyper-specific data points about this recipient

### 🚩 The "Obvious" Problem
- States something I definitely already know
- No new perspective
- Wastes my time
- **Fix:** Find the non-obvious connection or insight

### 🚩 The "Effort" Problem
- Requires significant work from me
- Complex CTA
- Mental gymnastics to understand value
- **Fix:** Make action dead simple and value instant

---

## Evaluation Documentation Format

For each PVP evaluated, document:

```markdown
## PVP Evaluation: [Concept Title]

### Message Being Evaluated:
```
[Full message text]
```

### Persona Role-Play (CYNICAL BUYER):
"I am [Job Title] at [Company Type]. I am EXHAUSTED. I receive 150+ emails per day and hate generic pitches. Today I'm dealing with [top pain]. I reply to MAYBE one sales email per week. The bar is 'Holy shit, I need to act on this immediately' or DELETE."

### Scoring:

**1. Situation Recognition:** [Score]/10
- [Why this score? What's specific or missing?]

**2. Data Credibility:** [Score]/10
- [Can I verify? Source quality?]

**3. Insight Value:** [Score]/10
- [Do I already know this? Is it non-obvious?]

**4. Actionability:** [Score]/10
- [What action? Do I have all info?]

**5. Recipient Effort:** [Score]/10
- [How much work? How simple is reply?]

**6. Impact & Urgency:** [Score]/10
- [KPI/money impact? Timeline?]

**7. Emotional Resonance:** [Score]/10
- [Gut reaction? Will I remember it?]

**AVERAGE SCORE:** [X.X]/10

### THREE MANDATORY LITMUS TESTS:

**Litmus Test 1 - "So What?":** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
- Action I can take: [specific action or "none"]
- What changes: [specific impact or "nothing"]
- Verdict: [Pass/Fail with rationale]

**Litmus Test 2 - "Wikipedia":** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
- Could I find this in 30 seconds on Google?: YES / NO
- What makes this non-obvious: [explanation or "nothing"]
- Verdict: [Pass/Fail with rationale]

**Litmus Test 3 - "Competitor":** ✅ PASS / ❌ FAIL
- Could any competitor send this exact message?: YES / NO
- What makes this uniquely from this sender: [explanation or "nothing"]
- Verdict: [Pass/Fail with rationale]

**LITMUS TESTS SUMMARY:** [X]/3 PASSED
- If any FAIL → AUTO-DESTROY regardless of score

### Additional Reality Checks:
- **Forwarding Test:** YES / NO - [Why?]
- **Tomorrow Test:** YES / NO - [Why?]
- **Meeting Test:** NO / YES - [Why?]

### Verdict:
✅ **GOLD STANDARD** (8.0+ AND all 3 litmus tests pass) - Keep
⚠️ **MAYBE ZONE** (7.0-7.9) - MANDATORY REVISION (one attempt, must reach 8.0+)
❌ **DESTROY** (<7.0 OR any litmus test fails) - Start over

### Rationale from CYNICAL Buyer Perspective:
[2-3 sentences explaining why I would/wouldn't reply as the exhausted, skeptical buyer. Be BRUTALLY honest. "Pretty good" = NO. "Maybe" = NO. Only "Holy shit, I need this" = YES.]

### If MAYBE ZONE (7.0-7.9) - Revision Plan:
- Weakest criteria: [which scored lowest]
- Litmus test concern: [which nearly failed]
- Specific revision: [what to change]
- Expected improvement: [what score should become]
```

---

## Key Principles

1. **Stay in character** - You are the BUYER, not evaluating as a marketer
2. **"Maybe" = NO** - If you're not sure you'd reply, you wouldn't
3. **Be brutal** - Better to destroy 10 mediocre PVPs than ship 1 bad one
4. **Specificity matters** - Vague = low score
5. **Verify = trust** - If you can't verify, score drops
6. **Effort = friction** - High effort = low score
7. **8.0+ or bust** - Gold Standard threshold is non-negotiable

---
