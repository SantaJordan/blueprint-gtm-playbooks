# Blueprint Turbo - Documentation

## Overview

Blueprint Turbo is an optimized implementation of the Blueprint GTM Intelligence System designed for **ultra-fast execution (12-15 minutes)** during live sales calls. It maintains the core quality standards of the original methodology while achieving **60-70% speed improvement** through massive parallelization and intelligent orchestration.

### Key Innovations

1. **4-Wave Parallel Execution**
   - Wave 1: 15-20 parallel intelligence gathering calls
   - Wave 2: 5-8 parallel database validation calls
   - Sequential Thinking MCP for quality synthesis
   - Browser MCP for 3x-5x faster portal scraping

2. **Live Database Discovery**
   - NO pre-built catalogs (works for ANY vertical)
   - Dynamic industry-based database search
   - Always current field names (verified from live portals)
   - Adapts automatically to healthcare, manufacturing, logistics, fintech, etc.

3. **Sales Call Optimized**
   - Real-time progress hooks (Wave 1/4, 2/4, 3/4, 4/4)
   - No approval prompts during execution
   - Predictable 12-15 minute completion
   - Immediate HTML deliverable

4. **Quality-Optimized Shortcuts**
   - 2-3 segments (vs 3-5 original) - still representative
   - 2 PQS + 2 PVP messages (vs 3+3) - still valuable
   - 1 revision cycle (vs 2) - extended thinking compensates
   - Same core standards: 8.0+/10, HIGH feasibility, actual field names

## Architecture

### Execution Flow

```
User: /blueprint-turbo https://company.com

→ Wave 1: Parallel Intelligence (0-4 min)
  ├─ 15-20 parallel calls: WebFetch, WebSearch, Browser MCP
  ├─ Company data, ICP, persona, industry databases
  └─ Progress: "✅ Wave 1/4: Company intelligence gathered"

→ Synthesis: Sequential Thinking (4-6 min)
  ├─ MCP Sequential Thinking generates segments
  ├─ Validates data detectability assumptions
  └─ Progress: "🧠 Synthesis: Generated 2-3 pain segments"

→ Wave 2: Parallel Validation (6-9 min)
  ├─ 5-8 parallel Browser MCP database portal visits
  ├─ Extract field documentation, rate feasibility
  └─ Progress: "🔍 Wave 2/4: Found {N} HIGH feasibility segments"

→ Wave 3: Message + Critique (9-13 min)
  ├─ Generate 2 PQS + 2 PVP variants per segment
  ├─ Buyer critique with extended thinking
  └─ Progress: "📝 Wave 3/4: {N} messages scored 8.0+/10"

→ Wave 4: HTML Assembly (13-15 min)
  ├─ Template population with validated content
  └─ Progress: "✅ Wave 4/4: Playbook ready! → {filename}"

Total: 12-15 minutes
```

### Parallelization Strategy

**Wave 1 (Maximum Parallelization):**
- 4-5 parallel WebFetch calls (different company pages)
- 6-8 parallel WebSearch calls (reviews, pain points, persona)
- 4-6 parallel Browser MCP tabs (database discovery searches)
- All execute simultaneously → complete in 3-4 minutes

**Wave 2 (Parallel Database Research):**
- Open 3-5 database portals in parallel Browser MCP tabs
- Extract field docs from all tabs simultaneously
- Parallel WebSearch for supplementary documentation
- Complete in 3 minutes (vs 15 min sequential in original)

**Wave 3 (Focused Sequential):**
- Message generation can be parallelized but kept sequential for clarity
- Buyer critique sequential (extended thinking requires focus)
- Complete in 4 minutes

---

## Quality Standards

### Maintained Standards (Non-Negotiable)

- ✅ **Live website visits** - Never use cached knowledge, always fetch current content
- ✅ **Actual database field names** - Verified from live portals during Wave 2, not assumed
- ✅ **8.0+/10 buyer critique** - Extended thinking ensures first-pass quality meets bar
- ✅ **HIGH feasibility only** - Only segments with provable data proceed to messaging
- ✅ **Texada-level specificity** - Dates, record numbers, facility addresses, field values
- ✅ **Hard data only** - Government databases with timestamped records, no soft signals

### Acceptable Trade-Offs (for Speed)

- ↓ **2-3 segments** (vs 3-5 original) - Still sufficient coverage, faster validation
- ↓ **2 PQS + 2 PVP messages** (vs 3+3 original) - Still valuable, reduces generation time
- ↓ **1 revision cycle** (vs 2 original) - Extended thinking compensates for quality
- ↓ **Focused research** (vs exhaustive) - Parallel execution compensates for breadth

### Required MCP Servers

**1. Browser MCP**
- Purpose: Parallel tab management for database portal scraping
- Usage: Opens 5-10 portals simultaneously, extracts field docs
- Impact: 3x-5x faster than sequential WebFetch
- Verify: `/mcp` should show `mcp__browser-mcp__*` tools available
- Requires: Chrome or compatible browser installed

**2. Sequential Thinking MCP**
- Purpose: Enforced stepwise thinking for pain segment generation
- Usage: Validates segment hypotheses before committing to validation
- Impact: Higher quality segments = fewer validation dead-ends
- Verify: `/mcp` should show `mcp__sequential-thinking__sequentialthinking` tool
- Install: See [MCP servers list](https://github.com/modelcontextprotocol/servers)

### Permission Configuration

**Option 1: Auto-Accept Mode (Recommended for Sales Calls)**

Run with no interruptions:
```bash
# Set permission mode before starting call
Shift+Tab → Select "Auto-Accept Edits"

# Then run
/blueprint-turbo https://company.com
```

## Comparison to Original Blueprint Skills

### Speed Improvement

| Stage | Original Time | Turbo Time | Method | Improvement |
|-------|--------------|------------|--------|-------------|
| Stage 1 (Company Research) | 10-15 min | 4-6 min | Parallel fetches + Sequential Thinking | 50-60% |
| Stage 2 (Data Validation) | 15 min | 3 min | Parallel Browser MCP tabs | 80% |
| Stage 3 (Messaging) | 15 min | 4 min | Extended thinking + 1 revision | 73% |
| Stage 4 (HTML) | 5 min | 2 min | Fast template population | 60% |
| **Total** | **30-45 min** | **12-15 min** | **4-wave parallel execution** | **60-70%** |

### Architectural Differences

**Original Blueprint Skills:**
```
blueprint-company-research (manual invocation)
  ↓ (user reviews output, decides to proceed)
blueprint-data-research (manual invocation)
  ↓ (user reviews feasibility, decides to proceed)
blueprint-message-generation (manual invocation)
  ↓ (user reviews messages, decides to proceed)
blueprint-explainer-builder (manual invocation)
  ↓
HTML playbook

Total: 30-45 min + manual transition overhead
User involvement: High (4 manual invocations + 4 review points)
```

**Blueprint Turbo:**
```
/blueprint-turbo <url> (single command)
  → Wave 1 (parallel) → Synthesis (MCP) → Wave 2 (parallel) → Wave 3 (sequential) → Wave 4 (fast)
  ↓
HTML playbook

Total: 12-15 min, fully autonomous
User involvement: Zero (single invocation, no review points)
```

### Database Discovery Approach

**Original Skills:**
- Assumption: User knows which databases to check
- Research: Sequential portal visits, manual field verification
- Coverage: Depends on analyst's database knowledge
- Freshness: May use stale field assumptions

**Blueprint Turbo:**
- Assumption: Zero database knowledge required
- Research: Parallel industry-based search, live field extraction
- Coverage: Dynamic discovery finds industry-specific databases
- Freshness: Always verifies current field names from live portals

**Example:**

User wants to analyze a **SaaS company in logistics** (new vertical):

*Original Skills:*
1. User must know FMCSA, DOT, state transportation databases exist
2. User manually provides database URLs
3. User verifies field names are current
4. Time: 10-15 min of upfront research

*Blueprint Turbo:*
1. Wave 1 identifies "logistics" industry automatically
2. Browser MCP searches "logistics government database" and opens top 5 results
3. Extracts field documentation from live portals in parallel
4. Time: 3-4 min, zero user knowledge required

## Troubleshooting

### Issue: "Browser MCP tools not found"

**Symptom:** Command fails with "mcp__browser-mcp__chrome_navigate not available"

**Solution:**
1. Verify Browser MCP is installed: `/mcp`
2. Check Chrome/browser is running
3. Restart Claude Code if needed
4. Fallback: System will use WebFetch instead (slower but functional)

---

### Issue: "Zero HIGH feasibility segments found"

**Symptom:** Wave 2 completes but all segments rated MEDIUM/LOW/UNDETECTABLE

**Cause:** Industry databases don't support the generated segments

**Solutions:**
1. **Automatic:** System suggests 2 alternative segments, validates (+3 min)
2. **Manual:** Use top MEDIUM segment with disclaimer in HTML
3. **Expand:** Widen search to adjacent industries for more databases

---

### Issue: "All messages score <8.0 after revision"

**Symptom:** Wave 3 cannot find 4 messages that meet quality bar

**Cause:** Segments don't have strong enough insights or data is too generic

**Solutions:**
1. **Automatic:** Generate 2 additional variants, re-critique (+2 min)
2. **Quality gate:** Lower threshold to 7.5 with disclaimer in HTML
3. **Restart:** Return to synthesis, generate different segments

---

### Issue: "Execution takes >15 minutes"

**Symptom:** Command doesn't complete in target 12-15 min window

**Causes & Solutions:**
- **Slow network:** Parallel calls waiting on responses → Use faster connection
- **Complex industry:** Many databases to research → Acceptable 15-18 min
- **Browser MCP slow:** Chrome not responding → Restart browser
- **Fallbacks triggered:** System degraded to WebFetch → Accept slower time or troubleshoot MCP

---

### Issue: "Website requires JavaScript, WebFetch fails"

**Symptom:** Company website is SPA, Wave 1 WebFetch returns empty content

**Solution:** System automatically falls back to Browser MCP chrome_navigate + chrome_get_web_content (+30 sec)

---

## Best Practices

### Before the Sales Call

1. **Test run** on a known company to verify 12-15 min timing
2. **Check MCP servers** are responding (`/mcp` to verify)
3. **Set permission mode** to auto-accept for uninterrupted flow
4. **Prepare company URL** - verify it's accessible
5. **Close other browser tabs** - ensure Browser MCP has clean environment

### During the Sales Call

1. **Kick off command early** - start while doing intro small talk
2. **Watch progress hooks** - glance at "Wave 2/4..." to track timing
3. **Don't interrupt** - let autonomous execution complete
4. **Have backup plan** - if fails, pivot to manual research

### After Execution

1. **Quick QA** - verify HTML has 2 PQS + 2 PVP play cards
2. **Spot-check data** - confirm field names look realistic (not hallucinated)
3. **Review messaging** - ensure 8.0+ messages are actually compelling
4. **Send immediately** - HTML is ready to forward to prospect

## Performance Expectations

### Timing Breakdown (Target)

| Phase | Time | Variance | Notes |
|-------|------|----------|-------|
| Wave 1 | 3-4 min | ±1 min | Network latency affects parallel calls |
| Synthesis | 2 min | ±0.5 min | Sequential Thinking is consistent |
| Wave 2 | 3 min | ±1 min | Database portal response times vary |
| Wave 3 | 4 min | ±1 min | Extended thinking adds consistency |
| Wave 4 | 2 min | ±0.5 min | Template population is fast |
| **Total** | **14 min** | **±3 min** | **Realistic range: 12-17 min** |

### Best Case Scenario (10-12 min)

Conditions:
- Fast network connection
- All parallel calls complete quickly
- Databases respond immediately
- First-pass messages score 8.0+
- No fallbacks triggered

### Worst Case Scenario (18-20 min)

Conditions:
- Slow network or portal timeouts
- Browser MCP fallback to WebFetch
- Zero HIGH segments → regenerate alternatives
- All messages need revision
- Complex industry with many databases

**Still faster than original 30-45 min!**

### Use Case 1: Live Sales Call Discovery

**Scenario:** On Zoom with prospect, need GTM intelligence ASAP

**Workflow:**
1. Get prospect's company URL during intro
2. Run `/blueprint-turbo https://prospect-company.com`
3. Continue discovery questions while system executes (12-15 min)
4. Review HTML playbook during final 5 min of call
5. Send playbook immediately after call with personalized note

**Outcome:** Prospect receives data-driven playbook within 30 min of call ending

---

### Use Case 2: Rapid Market Research

**Scenario:** Evaluating 5-10 companies in new vertical for TAM analysis

**Workflow:**
1. Run blueprint-turbo sequentially for each company
2. Each takes 12-15 min
3. Total time for 5 companies: 60-75 min (vs 150-225 min with original)
4. Compare pain segments, databases, message themes across companies

**Outcome:** Market segmentation analysis complete in ~1 hour

---

### Use Case 3: Sales Demo Content

**Scenario:** Preparing for conference booth demo, need fresh examples

**Workflow:**
1. Identify 2-3 target accounts attending conference
2. Run blueprint-turbo for each the morning of the conference
3. Have current, specific playbooks ready for booth conversations
4. Reference exact data (EPA violations, CMS metrics, etc.) during demos

**Outcome:** Conference attendees see live, personalized examples

## Limitations & Constraints

### What Blueprint Turbo Cannot Do

- ❌ **Second-layer analysis** (research ICP's customers) - skipped for speed
- ❌ **Exhaustive segment exploration** (3-5 segments) - focuses on 2-3
- ❌ **Multiple revision cycles** (2 max) - stops at 1 to save time
- ❌ **Deep persona research** (forums, job boards) - targeted search only
- ❌ **Soft signal integration** (job postings, M&A) - hard data only (same as original)

### When NOT to Use Blueprint Turbo

- ⏸ **Strategic planning sessions** - use original skills for depth
- ⏸ **Board presentations** - need maximum thoroughness, not speed
- ⏸ **Content marketing** - exhaustive research preferred
- ⏸ **Unknown industries** - if database landscape unclear, original may be safer

### Technical Constraints

- **Parallel call limit:** ~20 simultaneous tool calls (Claude Code limit)
- **Browser MCP dependency:** Requires functioning browser, adds complexity
- **Network sensitivity:** Slow connections will extend timing
- **MCP availability:** If servers down, falls back to slower methods
