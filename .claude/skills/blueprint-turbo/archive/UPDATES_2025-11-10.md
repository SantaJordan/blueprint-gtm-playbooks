# Blueprint Turbo Updates - November 10, 2025

## Summary

Fixed critical misunderstanding of PVP (Permissionless Value Prop) definition based on Wingwork cannonball analysis and real-world examples (Floorzap, Skimmer).

## Core Problem Identified

The turbo process was generating **messages that scored 7.8-8.0/10 but weren't actually PVPs** - they were strong PQS messages being incorrectly labeled as PVPs.

### What Was Wrong

**Old Understanding:**
- PVP = "synthesizes 2+ data sources to describe pain"
- Example: "Your mixed-fleet creates hiring disadvantage" (7.8/10)
- Problem: Describes pain but provides NO actionable solution

**Correct Understanding:**
- PVP = "message so valuable you can take action WITHOUT replying"
- Example: "Call agent Sheila Gibbs at sheila@gibbshomesales.com, 405-532-3212 about property lead"
- Key: Contains COMPLETE actionable information (names, contacts, prices, dates)

## Key Changes Made

### 1. Updated PVP Definition in `methodology.md`

**Added new section: "PVP vs PQS: The Critical Distinction"**

Location: Line 201-265 in methodology.md

Key additions:
- PQS: "I think you're in this painful situation, am I right?" (Target: 7.0-8.4/10)
- PVP: "Here's the complete actionable thing you can do RIGHT NOW" (Target: 8.5+/10)
- The "Independently Useful Test": Can recipient take action WITHOUT replying?

**Added "What Makes Information Complete for PVPs"**

Checklists for different PVP types:
- Lead Generation PVPs: property addresses, contact names, phone/email, timing
- Pricing/Procurement PVPs: vendor names, exact prices, contact info
- Compliance/Regulatory PVPs: regulation numbers, deadlines, required forms, approved vendors with contacts
- Competitive Intelligence PVPs: competitor names, exact metrics, recommended actions

### 2. Added Real-World Examples

**Added 3 TRUE PVP examples in `methodology.md`:**

1. **Floorzap** (Real Estate Lead):
   - Property address: 18904 Bajo Dr, Edmond, OK 73012
   - Agent: Sheila Gibbs, sheila@gibbshomesales.com, 405-532-3212
   - Why it works: Complete contact info, can call agent NOW

2. **Skimmer** (Pool Service Pricing):
   - Market rate: $169 for 95125 zip code
   - Range: $108-$184
   - Why it works: Can adjust pricing NOW without replying

3. **Skimmer** (Chemical Usage):
   - Target: 2.3 lbs chlorine (vs 3.8 lbs average)
   - Suppliers: Sunbelt, PoolCorp at $4.20/lb in Phoenix
   - Why it works: Can call suppliers and change ordering NOW

**Added Anti-Pattern Example:**

Shows Wingwork "mechanic shortage" message that FAILS as PVP but WORKS as Strong PQS:
- Describes pain but missing: WHO to recruit, WHERE to find them, HOW to contact them
- Demonstrates how to fix it into TRUE PVP (add mechanic names, LinkedIn profiles, contacts)

### 3. Updated Scoring Thresholds

**Old Thresholds:**
- PVP: 8.0+/10
- PQS: 6.0-7.9/10

**New Thresholds:**
- TRUE PVP: **8.5+/10** (raised bar)
- Strong PQS: **7.0-8.4/10** (excellent pain identification)
- Solid PQS: **7.0-7.4/10** (good with disclosed limitations)

**Rationale:**
- True PVPs are RARE and require complete action data
- Most messages scoring 7.0-8.4 are actually excellent PQS messages
- Honest classification > forcing weak PVPs

### 4. Added Action Extraction & Completeness Check Phase

**New Phase A.5 in `blueprint-turbo.md` command:**

Location: Line 601-716 in blueprint-turbo.md

**Before buyer critique, check each PVP candidate:**

Step 1: Identify intended action
- Valid: Call person, contact vendor, visit location, change process
- Invalid: "Consider challenges," "Think about this," "Be aware"

Step 2: Check information completeness
- Call person: name, phone/email, context ✓
- Contact vendor: name, pricing, contact info ✓
- Change process: benchmarks, steps, tools with contacts ✓

Step 3: Classification verdict
- **CLASSIFY AS TRUE PVP:** All required info present, passes Independently Useful Test
- **RECLASSIFY AS STRONG PQS:** Missing info, recipient must reply, still valuable!

**This phase runs BEFORE buyer critique to set correct target scores.**

### 5. Updated Quality Gate Standards

**New realistic expectations in `methodology.md` (Line 712-749):**

**Ideal Case (Data-Rich):**
- 2 TRUE PVPs (8.5+, complete action info)
- 2 Strong PQS (7.5-8.4, pain identification)

**Typical Case (Most Verticals):**
- 0-1 TRUE PVPs (if complete action data available)
- 3-4 Strong PQS (excellent pain identification)

**Challenging Case (Operational Pain):**
- 0 TRUE PVPs (no public action data)
- 2-4 Strong PQS (best possible with available data)

**Key principle: Don't force PVPs. Strong PQS (7.5-8.0) is excellent.**

### 6. Updated Message Format Requirements

**PVP messages now MUST include:**
- Complete actionable information (names, contacts, prices, dates)
- Recipient can take action WITHOUT replying
- No "promises of future value" ("I'll send you..." patterns banned)

**PQS messages remain:**
- Pain identification with data
- Seeks confirmation/engagement
- May provide partial information

### 7. Updated Buyer Critique Verdict System

**New verdict structure in `blueprint-turbo.md` (Line 762-777):**

**For TRUE PVP messages:**
- KEEP: ≥8.5 AND passes all 3 Texada criteria
- REVISE: 7.0-8.4 OR fails 1-2 criteria
- DESTROY: <7.0 OR fails all criteria

**For STRONG PQS messages:**
- KEEP: ≥7.0 AND passes all 3 Texada criteria
- REVISE: 6.0-6.9 OR fails 1-2 criteria
- DESTROY: <6.0 OR fails all criteria

### 8. Updated Final Selection Process

**New selection targets in `blueprint-turbo.md` (Line 791-830):**

- Count TRUE PVPs (≥8.5 + Independently Useful Test)
- Count Strong PQS (7.0-8.4)
- Select best 4 messages total (any mix)
- Minimum: 4 messages at ≥7.0/10

**Classification labeling for HTML:**
- "TRUE PVP (8.5+)": Complete actionable information, independently useful
- "Strong PQS (7.5-8.4)": Excellent pain identification, seeks engagement
- "Solid PQS (7.0-7.4)": Good pain identification with disclosed limitations

## Why These Changes Matter

### Before (Wingwork Turbo Output)

**Classified as "PVP" but scored 7.8/10:**
```
Subject: Your mechanic shortage problem

ATEC shows 5,338 A&P mechanic shortage. Your 7-aircraft mixed-fleet
requires training across 4 manufacturers vs. single-type operators.

How are you managing maintenance capacity?
```

**Problems:**
- ❌ No actionable information (WHO to recruit, HOW to contact them)
- ❌ Recipient cannot take action without replying
- ❌ Fails "Independently Useful Test"
- ✅ BUT excellent pain identification!

**Correct classification:** STRONG PQS (7.5-8.0/10), NOT PVP

### After (Fixed Understanding)

**TRUE PVP example:**
```
Subject: 3 Dallas A&P mechanics with your certs

These 3 A&P mechanics in Dallas have King Air + Citation certs:
- Robert Martinez (LinkedIn: /in/robertmartinez-ap) - Lone Star Aviation
- Jennifer Chen (LinkedIn: /in/jchen-mechanic) - DFW Maintenance
- Mike Thompson (LinkedIn: /in/mikethompson-amt) - Texas Air Service

Mixed-fleet operators pay $8-12/hour premium in Dallas market.

Want their employers' turnover data?
```

**Why this is TRUE PVP:**
- ✅ Complete actionable information (names, LinkedIn profiles, employers)
- ✅ Recipient can recruit these people NOW without replying
- ✅ Passes "Independently Useful Test"
- ✅ Target score: 8.5+/10

## Impact on Wingwork Assessment

**Old turbo output conclusion:**
- "Challenging use case" (7.8-8.0/10 scores)
- Generated "PVPs" that weren't actually PVPs

**Correct assessment with new understanding:**
- **Strong PQS opportunity** (7.5-8.0/10 is excellent for operational pain)
- **Limited TRUE PVP opportunity** with public data alone
- Missing complete action data: mechanic contacts, vendor pricing, shop lead times
- **Honest conclusion:** Generate excellent PQS messages, acknowledge PVP would require proprietary databases

## Files Modified

1. **`.claude/skills/blueprint-turbo/prompts/methodology.md`**
   - Added PVP vs PQS distinction (Line 201-265)
   - Added "What Makes Information Complete" (Line 237-264)
   - Updated PVP Message Format with examples (Line 266-410)
   - Added Action Extraction & Completeness Check section (Line 563-695)
   - Updated Quality Gate Standards (Line 698-749)
   - Updated Quality Standards by Tier (Line 965-995)

2. **`.claude/commands/blueprint-turbo.md`**
   - Added Phase A.5: Action Extraction & Completeness Check (Line 601-716)
   - Updated Phase B: Buyer Critique verdicts (Line 762-777)
   - Updated Phase D: Final Selection (Line 789-830)

## Testing Recommendations

**Test with Wingwork scenario:**
1. Run updated turbo on wingwork.com
2. Verify mechanic shortage message is classified as STRONG PQS (not weak PVP)
3. Verify score targets: TRUE PVP = 8.5+, Strong PQS = 7.0-8.4
4. Check that assessment doesn't label it "challenging" when generating excellent PQS messages
5. Verify HTML output clearly labels: "TRUE PVP" vs "Strong PQS"

**Expected outcome:**
- 0 TRUE PVPs (no complete action data available from FAA databases)
- 2-3 Strong PQS (7.5-8.0/10, excellent mechanic shortage / compliance deadline messages)
- Honest assessment: "Strong PQS opportunity, PVP would require additional data: [mechanic database, vendor catalog, shop directory]"

## Key Principles Established

1. **PVP = Independently Useful**
   - Recipient can take action WITHOUT replying
   - Contains complete information (names, contacts, prices, dates)
   - Test: "Can they act on this without talking to me?"

2. **Strong PQS ≠ Weak PVP**
   - A message scoring 8.0 without complete action info is STRONG PQS, not weak PVP
   - PQS messages are valuable and effective
   - Don't force PVP classification

3. **Honest Assessment > Inflated Scores**
   - Most verticals won't have TRUE PVPs (8.5+) with public data alone
   - Generating 3-4 STRONG PQS (7.5-8.0) is excellent
   - Be transparent about what data would be needed for TRUE PVPs

4. **Synthesis ≠ Complete Action**
   - Synthesizing 2+ data sources describes pain
   - TRUE PVP requires ADDITIONALLY: names, contacts, prices, steps
   - Both are valuable but serve different purposes
