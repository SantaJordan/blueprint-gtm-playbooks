Hi [First Name],

I noticed on LinkedIn that [Hospital Name] recently expanded your service lines. Congrats on the growth!

I wanted to reach out because we work with health systems like Houston Methodist and others to help with patient scheduling and referral management.

Our platform provides real-time scheduling, reduces call center volume by 40%, and improves patient satisfaction. We've helped systems reduce patient leakage by up to 25%.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how we might be able to help [Hospital Name]?

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> The prospect is a Director of Patient Access who's dealt with scheduling vendors for years. They've seen this template 1,000 times.

The disconnect between overall quality and responsiveness creates internal tension that scheduling technology can address.</p>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> The buyer knows their HCAHPS scores but may not have framed the "clinical quality vs. operational access" gap this way. By connecting their responsiveness score to referral leakage risk, you're offering a new lens on familiar data. The question "Is that what you're seeing internally?" requires zero effort to answer and opens conversation.</p>

Your facility's HCAHPS reports 54% of patients said staff "always" responded quickly—13 points below the 67% national benchmark. Interestingly, your overall star rating is 4 stars, suggesting strong clinical care but an access bottleneck.

The gap usually lives in scheduling coordination: patients waiting on hold, referrals falling through cracks, staff manually checking calendars across departments. Is that what you're seeing internally?</div>

Jefferson Health completed the Lehigh Valley merger in August 2024—32 hospitals, multiple EMRs, 6 months into integration. The typical pattern: scheduling systems that don't talk to each other, referrals that disappear between legacy platforms, and patients who can't book across the full network.

I reviewed CMS facility data for your newly merged system—32 hospitals across two legacy networks. Based on typical multi-EMR environments, there are likely 3-5 scheduling platforms that don't share real-time availability with each other.

Houston Methodist tackled this same challenge—6 hospitals, 1,890 physicians, multiple EMR systems—and built a unified scheduling layer that gives patients and staff access to network-wide availability in real-time.

I can walk through their architecture if that's relevant to your integration timeline. Who's leading scheduling integration on your side?</div>

            <p>Notice the difference? Traditional outreach talks about YOUR product and YOUR benefits. Blueprint GTM talks about THEIR situation and THEIR challenges using verifiable CMS data they can look up themselves.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The shift is simple but profound:</strong></p>
                <p>Stop sending messages about what you do. Start sending intelligence about what they need to know right now. When you lead with "54% staff responsiveness—13 points below the 67% national benchmark" instead of "we help with patient scheduling," you're not another sales email—you're the person who actually pulled their HCAHPS data.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This isn't about templates or tactics. It's about building a systematic way to identify hospitals experiencing specific, urgent challenges where Blockit's multi-EMR scheduling platform provides unique value—and proving you've done the homework with CMS data and merger timelines.</p>
