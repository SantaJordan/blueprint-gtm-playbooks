            <h2>Who the Hell is Jordan Crawford?</h2>

            <p>Founder of Blueprint GTM. Built a business by scraping 25M+ job posts to find company pain points. Believes the Predictable Revenue model is dead. Thinks mounting an AI SDR on outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse—no one gets anywhere, and it still shits along the way.</p>

            <p>The core philosophy is simple: The message isn't the problem. The LIST is the message. When you know exactly who to target and why they need you right now, the message writes itself.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2: The Old Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Old Way (What Everyone Does)</h2>

            <p>Let's be brutally honest about what your GTM team is doing right now. They're buying lists from ZoomInfo, adding some "personalization" like mentioning a LinkedIn post, then blasting generic messages about features. Here's what it actually looks like:</p>

            <div class="old-way-example">
                <p><strong>The Typical Hint Health SDR Email:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: Quick Question about Your DPC Practice

Hi Dr. [First Name],

I noticed on LinkedIn that your practice has been growing lately. Congrats!

I wanted to reach out because we work with DPC practices like yours to help streamline billing and membership management.

Hint Health provides:
- Automated membership billing
- Employer contracting support
- A nationwide DPC network

Would you have 15 minutes next week to explore how we might help your practice?

Best,
Generic SDR</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Every DPC physician gets 10 of these per week. "I noticed you're growing" is LinkedIn stalking, not insight. Listing features tells them nothing about their specific situation. The 15-minute meeting request before providing any value? Delete.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3: The New Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The New Way: Intelligence-Driven GTM</h2>

            <p>Blueprint GTM flips the entire approach. Instead of interrupting DPC practices with pitches, you deliver insights so valuable they'd pay consulting fees to receive them. You become the person who helps them see around corners, not another vendor in their inbox.</p>

            <p>This requires two fundamental shifts:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>1. Hard Data Over Soft Signals</h3>
                <p><strong>Stop:</strong> "I see you're growing your practice" (obvious, everyone sees this)</p>
                <p><strong>Start:</strong> "Your 47 Google reviews in the last 90 days puts you at top 12% velocity in Colorado. At this rate, you'll hit 600-patient capacity in 8 months." (specific, calculated, actionable)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>2. Mirror Situations, Don't Pitch Solutions</h3>
                <p><strong>PQS (Pain-Qualified Segment):</strong> Reflect their exact situation—practice type, market position, compliance status—with such specificity they think "how did you know?"</p>
                <p><strong>PVP (Permissionless Value Proposition):</strong> Deliver immediate value: county-level employer data, compliance gap alerts, competitor intelligence—whether they buy or not.</p>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> Compliance is scary. DPC practices must formally opt out of Medicare to charge membership fees to Medicare beneficiaries. Most don't realize this requirement, and the fix is a simple 2-page form. You're surfacing a real risk AND providing the solution in the same email.</p>
                </div>

I cross-referenced DPC Frontier listings against CMS's Medicare Opt-Out database. Your practice appears in DPC Frontier (listed since March 2023) but you're not on the CMS Opt-Out list.

If you're seeing any Medicare-eligible patients and charging membership fees, that's technically a compliance issue—CMS requires formal opt-out to charge Medicare beneficiaries outside the program.

The opt-out process is a 2-page form (CMS-460) with your MAC. Want me to send the form with instructions, or is there someone else on your team who handles compliance?</div>

                <div class="message-example">Subject: 8 months to capacity

Your practice added 47 Google reviews in the last 90 days—top 12% velocity in Colorado. Using DPC industry benchmarks (1 review ≈ 8 new patients), that's roughly 125 new members per quarter. At 412 current members and 600 capacity, you'll hit your panel limit around August 2026.

Most solo DPC docs face this choice: close the panel and leave revenue on the table, or add a provider and face billing complexity. There's a third option—employer contracts let you monetize a waitlist at higher per-member rates.

                <h3>Play 4: Competitor Move Alert</h3>

                <div class="play-explanation">
                    <p><strong>What's the play?</strong> Track new DPC practice listings in their market radius. When a competitor makes a strategic move (employer partnerships, network expansion), surface it as a competitive intelligence alert.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="data-sources">
                    <strong>Data sources:</strong> DPC Frontier Mapper (new listings) + LinkedIn activity monitoring + Census employer data | Confidence: 85%

                <p><strong>The message:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: Dr. Kim launching employer contracts

Foothills Direct Care (Dr. Sarah Kim, opened June, 12 miles from you) just listed on LinkedIn that she's "excited to announce our first employer partnership." She's moving faster than typical new practices.

You've got 18 months of relationships and 412 members she doesn't. But if she locks up Lockheed Martin or Ball Aerospace first (both HQ'd between you), that's 2,000+ potential members off the table.

Want the list of 50+ employee companies within 10 miles of your practice that aren't yet contracted with any DPC?</div>

        <!-- SECTION 7: The Transformation -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Transformation</h2>

            <p>Notice the difference? Traditional outreach talks about YOUR product and YOUR benefits. Blueprint GTM talks about THEIR situation and THEIR challenges using verifiable data they can look up themselves.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The shift is simple but profound:</strong></p>
                <p>Stop sending messages about what Hint does. Start sending intelligence about what DPC physicians need to know right now. When you lead with "Medicare opt-out gap detected" or "47 employers entering benefits season" instead of "I noticed you're growing," you're not another sales email—you're the person who actually did the research.</p>
            </div>

            <p>This isn't about templates or tactics. It's about building a systematic way to identify DPC practices experiencing specific, urgent challenges where Hint's solutions provide unique value—and proving you've done the homework with CMS records, DPC Frontier data, and county-level analysis.</p>

            <p>The companies that master this approach don't compete on features. They compete on intelligence.</p>
