            <h1>Blueprint GTM Playbook for Optery</h1>

            <h2>Who the Hell is Jordan Crawford?</h2>

            <p>Founder of Blueprint GTM. Built a business by scraping 25M+ job posts to find company pain points. Believes the Predictable Revenue model is dead. Thinks mounting an AI SDR on outdated methodology is like putting a legless robot on a horse—no one gets anywhere, and it still shits along the way.</p>

            <p>The core philosophy is simple: The message isn't the problem. The LIST is the message. When you know exactly who to target and why they need you right now, the message writes itself.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 2: The Old Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The Old Way (What Everyone Does)</h2>

            <p>Let's be brutally honest about what your GTM team is doing right now. They're buying lists from ZoomInfo, adding some "personalization" like mentioning a LinkedIn post, then blasting generic messages about features. Here's what it actually looks like:</p>

            <div class="old-way-example">
                <p><strong>The Typical Optery SDR Email:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: Quick Question About Data Privacy at [Company]

Hi [First Name],

I came across your LinkedIn profile and noticed you're responsible for security at [Company]. Impressive background!

I wanted to reach out because we work with companies like Stripe and Coinbase to help protect employee privacy by removing personal information from data broker sites.

Our platform automatically removes data from 630+ sites, provides screenshot verification, and continuously monitors for re-listings. We've been named PCMag's Editors' Choice for 3 years running.

Would you have 15 minutes next week to discuss how we could help protect your team's privacy?

Best,
[SDR Name]</div>
            </div>

            <p><strong>Why this fails:</strong> Every CISO gets 10 of these a week. "I noticed your impressive background" is transparent flattery. Mentioning Stripe and Coinbase means nothing—they have different risk profiles. And "protect your team's privacy" is vague. What threat? Why now? Delete.</p>
        </div>

        <!-- SECTION 3: The New Way -->
        <div class="section">
            <h2>The New Way: Intelligence-Driven GTM</h2>

            <p>Blueprint GTM flips the entire approach. Instead of interrupting prospects with pitches, you deliver insights so valuable they'd pay consulting fees to receive them. You become the person who helps them see around corners, not another vendor in their inbox.</p>

            <p>This requires two fundamental shifts:</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>1. Hard Data Over Soft Signals</h3>
                <p><strong>Stop:</strong> "I see you're hiring security people" (job postings - everyone sees this)</p>
                <p><strong>Start:</strong> "Your March 15th HIPAA breach affecting 847,000 individuals means employee data is now circulating—making your team prime targets for follow-up social engineering attacks" (HHS OCR portal data)</p>
            </div>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <h3>2. Mirror Situations, Don't Pitch Solutions</h3>
                <p><strong>PQS (Pain-Qualified Segment):</strong> Reflect their exact situation with such specificity they think "how did you know?" Use government data with dates, record numbers, breach sizes.</p>
                <p><strong>PVP (Permissionless Value Proposition):</strong> Deliver immediate value they can use today - like showing them exactly where their CEO's home address is exposed across 47 data broker sites - whether they buy or not.</p>

Your organization's March 2024 breach affecting 847,000 individuals was a network server hacking incident—which means employee credentials and PII were likely part of what was exfiltrated.

Here's what most breach response misses: within 60-90 days of a major breach, employee personal information starts appearing on data broker sites as the data circulates. Your IT staff, HR team, and executives become prime targets for follow-up social engineering attacks using their home addresses, phone numbers, and family member names pulled from Whitepages and Spokeo.

Are you seeing an uptick in targeted phishing attempts on employees since March?</div>

                <div class="play-explanation">
                    <p><strong>What's the play?</strong> Target public companies that have filed SEC Form 8-K Item 1.05 disclosing a material cybersecurity incident. Since December 2023, public companies must disclose material cyber incidents within 4 business days. These filings are a public signal that the company was breached AND that threat actors know they're vulnerable. Executives at these companies become high-value targets for follow-up attacks.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> The 8-K filing is recent (rule effective Dec 2023) and creates a unique moment of vulnerability. The CISO is focused on incident response and SEC compliance—not on the fact that their executives' personal information on data broker sites makes them prime targets for spear phishing. 241 companies have filed cyber 8-Ks so far. Buyer critique score: 8.0/10 (specific filing date, non-obvious second-order risk).</p>

Your December 15th 8-K disclosed a ransomware incident affecting customer data systems. That SEC filing does two things: it fulfills your disclosure obligation, and it tells every threat actor on the planet that your organization is currently vulnerable.

Post-disclosure, executives become high-value targets. The pattern we see: within 30 days of an 8-K cyber filing, spear phishing attempts on C-suite jump 3-4x—using personal details from data broker sites (home address, personal cell, spouse names) to bypass corporate email filters entirely.

Has your executive protection program addressed data broker exposure since the incident?</div>

I pulled together a free exposure report for your executive team. Here's what I found:

CEO John Smith: Appears on 47 data broker sites. Home address (123 Oak Lane, Palo Alto) visible on 12 sites including Whitepages and Spokeo. Personal cell exposed on 8 sites. Email john.smith@gmail.com appears in 4 breach databases.

CFO Sarah Chen: Appears on 41 sites. Home address visible on 9. Spouse name and children's names exposed on BeenVerified family records section.

The challenge: We removed a client's CEO from 47 sites in January. By June, 38 had re-listed him. Data brokers constantly scrape and re-aggregate. One-time removal is mopping during a flood.

                <h3>Play 2: Healthcare Executive Physical Security Alert (Post-Brian Thompson)</h3>

                <div class="play-explanation">
                    <p><strong>What's the play?</strong> Target healthcare, pharma, and biotech executives specifically. Following the Brian Thompson (UnitedHealthcare CEO) assassination in December 2024, healthcare executives are acutely aware of physical security risks. The attacker used OSINT to track movements. Their home addresses being publicly available on data broker sites is now an existential threat, not just a privacy concern. Deliver a specific exposure snapshot showing where their home address is visible.</p>
                </div>

                <div class="why-section">
                    <p><strong>Why this works:</strong> This is a "newspaper test" moment—healthcare executives are reading about this threat RIGHT NOW. The message connects the dots: your home address is on 31 data broker sites, the same OSINT techniques that enabled the Thompson attack are available to anyone with $20 and an internet connection. Emotional resonance is extremely high. Buyer critique score: 8.5/10 (extreme timeliness, physical safety stakes, specific data).</p>

                <div class="data-sources">
                    <strong>Data source:</strong> SEC EDGAR or NPI Registry for healthcare executive identification. Manual sampling of people-search sites. BlackCloak research shows healthcare/pharma/biotech are highest-risk industries for executive doxxing. Executive-level employees are 25-30% more exposed than regular workforce (DeleteMe research).

                <p><strong>The message:</strong></p>
                <div class="message-example">Subject: Your home address is public

Following Brian Thompson, I imagine physical security is top of mind.

I checked the major people-search sites for your executive team. Your CEO's home address at [redacted] appears on 31 data broker sites. The same OSINT techniques that enabled Thompson's attacker are available to anyone with an internet connection and $20 for a premium search.

luigiwasright.com and theceodatabase.com doxxed hundreds of healthcare executives in May 2025—full names, business emails, mobile phones, home addresses. Both sites have been taken down but the data is still circulating.

We can remove your leadership team's personal information from 630+ data broker sites within 72 hours. I've attached a preliminary exposure scan for your top 5 executives—no call needed to review it.

Worth a look given the current threat environment?</div>

            <h2>The Transformation</h2>

            <p>Notice the difference? Traditional outreach talks about YOUR product and YOUR benefits. Blueprint GTM talks about THEIR situation and THEIR challenges using verifiable data they can look up themselves.</p>

            <div class="highlight-box">
                <p><strong>The shift is simple but profound:</strong></p>
                <p>Stop sending messages about what you do. Start sending intelligence about what they need to know right now. When you lead with "Your March 2024 breach affecting 847,000 individuals" from the HHS OCR portal instead of "I see you're focused on security," you're not another sales email—you're the person who actually did the research.</p>
            </div>

            <p>For Optery specifically, the timing is remarkable. Healthcare executive protection has never been more urgent. The SEC 8-K cyber disclosure rule created a fresh list of vulnerable companies. And the user's insight about offering FREE exposure reports or FREE removals as a lead magnet is brilliant—it demonstrates the re-listing problem viscerally, creating the hook for ongoing subscription.</p>

            <p>The companies that master this approach don't compete on features. They compete on intelligence.</p>
