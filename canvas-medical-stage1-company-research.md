- **Clinical efficiency metrics**: Clinician time in EMR, patient volume per clinician (EMR impacts these directly)

**Core Pains & Frustrations:**

From job descriptions, forums, LinkedIn:
- **"We're hitting Epic's API rate limits and they want $50K to increase them"** - Vendor lock-in and lack of control
- **"Our clinicians threaten to quit if we don't fix the charting workflow"** - EMR usability directly impacts talent retention
- **"We need to launch in 5 new states but our EMR can't handle state-specific consent forms"** - Customization limitations blocking business growth
- **"ONC certification audit found gaps - now we're scrambling to remediate or risk losing CMS participation"** - Compliance surprises
- **"We want to deploy AI scribing but our EMR vendor says it violates their BAA"** - Innovation blocked by vendor policies
- **"Security audit found vulnerabilities in our EMR implementation - fixing it requires vendor involvement and $$"** - Lack of control over security posture
- **"We're paying $8K/month for an EMR we've outgrown but migration would take 8 months"** - Switching costs create vendor lock-in

**Information Environment:**

- **What they know**:
  - Software engineering best practices, cloud infrastructure, APIs
  - Healthcare compliance basics (HIPAA, ONC) but not deep healthcare regulatory expertise
  - Competitive landscape of EMR vendors (tried Athena, Epic, Cerner demos - too expensive/rigid)
  - Their own product roadmap and technical constraints

- **Blind spots**:
  - **What's actually required for ONC certification** (Is our current EMR compliant? Will we pass audit?)
  - **Upcoming regulatory deadlines** (When is the 2027 interoperability enforcement? What do we need to do NOW?)
  - **How other digital health startups solved this** (Are we the only ones struggling with EMR customization?)
  - **What's possible with modern EMR architecture** (Can an EMR actually be developer-friendly? Or is that marketing BS?)
  - **Real cost of legacy EMR** (What's the fully-loaded cost including customization, integration, opportunity cost of slow iteration?)

- **What impresses them**:
  - **"Here's exactly what ONC requires for FHIR API certification and the deadline to avoid CMS penalties"** (Specific regulatory intelligence they don't have time to research)
  - **"I analyzed your GitHub repos - you're building [X feature] which Canvas has in SDK out-of-box"** (Shows you understand their tech stack and can save engineering time)
  - **"Companies like yours hit EMR limitations around month 18-24 when X happens - here's the data"** (Pattern recognition from similar startups)
  - **"Your current EMR's API has these specific limitations [cite documentation] that will block your roadmap"** (Technical depth proving you did homework)
  - **"Here's the actual API response structure from Canvas FHIR endpoint vs your current vendor"** (Technical specifics, not marketing fluff)

**Value Drivers:**
- **Product velocity**: Can we ship features 2x faster?
- **Engineering leverage**: Can I reduce engineering time spent fighting EMR limitations?
- **Risk reduction**: Will this pass compliance audits and prevent breaches?
- **Talent retention**: Will clinicians actually like using this?
- **Cost efficiency**: Better ROI than current EMR spend?
- **Future-proofing**: Will this scale to 10x patient volume and support AI integration?

## Pain-Qualified Segment Hypotheses

### Segment 1: Post-ONC Audit Failures Requiring Remediation

**Trigger Event/Situation:**
Digital health company underwent ONC (Office of National Coordinator) certification audit for their existing EMR and received findings/deficiencies related to FHIR API implementation, information blocking provisions, or security requirements. They now face deadline to remediate (typically 30-90 days) or risk losing CMS Medicare/Medicaid participation eligibility.

**Core Pain/Challenge:**
- Current EMR vendor can't fix deficiencies quickly or wants $$$
- Risk: Losing CMS participation = can't bill Medicare/Medicaid = business-ending for many digital health models
- Timeline pressure: Must remediate within audit deadline
- Uncertainty: "Do we fix our current EMR or migrate to compliant one?"
- Board/investor panic: Compliance failure raises questions about management competence

**Brand Relevance:**
Canvas positions as "certified EMR infrastructure" with native ONC certification and FHIR API built-in. For companies facing audit remediation deadlines, Canvas offers pre-certified alternative vs. scrambling to fix non-compliant legacy EMR. Canvas's developer-friendly approach means faster migration than traditional EMR (weeks vs. months).

**Initial Data Hypothesis:**
- **ONC Certified Health IT Product List (CHPL)**: Public database showing certification status, surveillance results, and non-conformities for all ONC-certified health IT products
  - Companies with "Surveillance" or "Non-Conformity" flags in past 12 months
  - Products with expired certifications or pending updates
  - Surveillance activity dates indicating recent audits
- **CMS Quality Payment Program**: Eligible clinicians/groups who failed MIPS reporting due to CEHRT issues
- **ONC Information Blocking Complaints**: Public complaints filed about information blocking (may indicate audit triggers)
- **Healthcare IT News / EHR Intelligence**: Press releases about EMR vendors losing/suspending ONC certification

### Segment 2: Rapid Multi-State Expansion Hitting EMR Customization Limits

**Trigger Event/Situation:**
Digital health startup successfully launched in 1-5 initial states and now expanding to 10-20+ states rapidly (Series A/B growth stage). Discovering their current EMR cannot handle state-specific requirements: different consent forms, prescribing rules, documentation requirements, telehealth regulations. Current vendor says customization requires $30K-$100K+ per state or "not supported."

**Core Pain/Challenge:**
- **Revenue blocked**: Can't launch in new states = growth stalled = missing Board targets
- **Compliance risk**: Wrong consent form or documentation = state licensing violations
- **Manual workarounds**: Staff creating workarounds outside EMR (compliance nightmare)
- **Vendor bottleneck**: Current EMR vendor has 6-12 month backlog for custom development
- **Switching cost fear**: "If we migrate EMRs now, it'll take 6 months and cost $200K+"

**Brand Relevance:**
Canvas's SDK and API-first architecture enable state-specific customization without vendor involvement. Engineering team can build custom workflows, consent forms, documentation templates using Canvas SDK. For companies hitting customization walls with legacy EMRs, Canvas demonstrates how modern architecture eliminates vendor bottlenecks. The "Builder Plans" tier specifically targets companies needing developer control.

**Initial Data Hypothesis:**
- **State Medical Board Licensing Data**: Companies applying for medical licenses in multiple new states in past 6-12 months (indicates expansion)
  - Look for digital health/telehealth companies with recent multi-state applications
  - Pattern: 1-2 states year 1, then 5-10+ states year 2-3
- **State Telehealth Parity Laws**: Track new state telehealth legislation (companies must adapt EMR to comply)
- **Controlled Substance Registrations**: DEA and state CDS registrations (indicates prescribing in new states)
- **Crunchbase/Pitchbook**: Digital health companies raising Series A/B in past 12-18 months (funding enables expansion)
- **Healthcare Provider Credentialing Data**: CAQH or NPPES showing providers credentialed in multiple new states recently

### Segment 3: AI/ML Clinical Tools Blocked by Legacy EMR Vendor Policies

**Trigger Event/Situation:**
Digital health company built or licensed AI/ML clinical decision support tools (e.g., AI medical scribing, automated clinical protocol suggestions, predictive risk scoring) and wants to deploy into clinical workflows. Current EMR vendor blocks integration due to: "Not on approved vendor list," "Violates our BAA (Business Associate Agreement)," "API limitations prevent this use case," or "Custom integration costs $75K+."

**Core Pain/Challenge:**
- **Innovation blocked**: Competitive advantage (AI tools) can't be deployed = losing market position
- **Clinician dissatisfaction**: Promised clinicians "AI will reduce your charting burden" but can't deliver
- **Investor pressure**: VCs expect AI integration to drive efficiency metrics (patients per clinician)
- **Workaround hell**: Using AI tools outside EMR creates compliance issues (PHI exposure, fragmented workflows)
- **Build vs. buy dilemma**: "Do we build custom EMR integration for $200K or find new EMR?"

**Brand Relevance:**
Canvas explicitly positions as "Your only choice to safely integrate AI into healthcare" with "AI-powered protocols operating as agentic members of your care team." Canvas SDK + FHIR API enable companies to integrate any AI/ML tool without vendor approval. Pre-built frameworks for AI scribing, protocol automation. For companies blocked by legacy EMR vendors, Canvas is purpose-built for AI integration.

**Initial Data Hypothesis:**
- **AI/ML Clinical Tool Vendors**: Companies using products from Abridge, Nuance DAX, Suki, Notable, Ambiance (AI scribing vendors) - these customers hit EMR integration walls
- **FDA 510(k) Database**: Digital health companies filing for AI/ML SaMD (Software as Medical Device) clearance - indicates AI product development
- **Crunchbase/Pitchbook**: Digital health companies with "AI" or "machine learning" in description who raised funding in past 18 months
- **Healthcare AI News**: Press releases about AI clinical tool launches (indicates companies trying to deploy AI)
- **Clinical Trial Registry (ClinicalTrials.gov)**: Digital health studies involving AI/ML interventions - indicates mature AI development
- **GitHub**: Open-source healthcare AI projects from digital health companies (indicates in-house AI development)

### Segment 4: Post-Breach HIPAA Violations Triggering EMR Security Review

**Trigger Event/Situation:**
Healthcare organization experienced security incident (breach, unauthorized access, ransomware attempt) involving their EMR system in past 6-18 months. Following incident, conducted security assessment that identified vulnerabilities in EMR implementation, configuration, or access controls. Now facing: OCR investigation, required risk analysis, potential penalties, and Board/investor mandate to "fix EMR security or find new vendor."

**Core Pain/Challenge:**
- **Regulatory exposure**: OCR investigating = potential $1M+ penalty + corrective action plan
- **Reputation damage**: Breach disclosed publicly (>500 patients) = customer trust loss
- **Vendor blame game**: Current EMR vendor says "Not our fault, you misconfigured it" vs. "We don't support that security control"
- **Insurance pressure**: Cyber insurance threatening non-renewal or premium increase unless EMR security improved
- **Lack of control**: Can't implement security controls without vendor support/approval
- **Board scrutiny**: CTO/CIO on hot seat to demonstrate security improvements

**Brand Relevance:**
Canvas's cloud-native, modern architecture includes security controls by default (encryption, audit logging, MFA, role-based access). Developer control via SDK enables companies to implement custom security policies without vendor involvement. For companies burned by security incidents with legacy EMRs, Canvas demonstrates how modern architecture improves security posture and gives organization control vs. dependence on vendor.

**Initial Data Hypothesis:**
- **HHS Office for Civil Rights (OCR) Breach Portal**: "Wall of Shame" database showing all healthcare breaches affecting 500+ individuals
  - Filter for: Healthcare providers (not payers/clearinghouses), past 6-18 months, breach type "Hacking/IT Incident" or "Unauthorized Access/Disclosure"
  - Company names, breach dates, number of affected individuals
  - Location of breached information: "Electronic Medical Record" or "EMR/EHR"
- **OCR HIPAA Enforcement Actions**: Resolution agreements, corrective action plans, and penalties published by OCR
  - Recent settlements involving EMR security deficiencies
  - Dates of incidents and resolution (indicates timeline)
- **State Attorney General Healthcare Data Breach Notifications**: State-specific breach disclosure requirements (captures <500 patient breaches not in federal portal)
- **Healthcare Cybersecurity News**: HIT Infrastructure, Healthcare IT News, HIPAA Journal reporting on breaches

### Segment 5: Series A/B Digital Health Startups Outgrowing "Scrappy" EMR Solution

**Trigger Event/Situation:**
Digital health startup successfully proved product-market fit with 1,000-10,000 patients using "scrappy" initial EMR solution (basic cloud EMR like Practice Fusion, Kareo, or even homegrown system). Now raised Series A or B ($10M-$50M), hiring aggressively (10→50+ employees), expanding specialties/programs, and discovering current EMR can't scale: performance issues, lack of API, can't support multiple care protocols, clinicians complaining about usability.

**Core Pain/Challenge:**
- **Growth limited by EMR**: Can't onboard clinicians fast enough due to poor EMR training/usability
- **Product roadmap blocked**: Want to launch new clinical programs but EMR doesn't support workflows
- **Operational chaos**: Using 5+ point solutions (EMR + separate billing + separate scheduling + separate patient app) = data fragmentation
- **Investor pressure**: Board expects 3x patient growth but EMR can't handle scale
- **Migration fear**: "If we migrate EMRs now, we'll lose 3-6 months of product velocity"
- **Talent retention**: Clinicians threaten to quit due to poor EMR experience

**Brand Relevance:**
Canvas targets this exact transition point: startups who proved PMF with basic EMR and now need "real" EMR infrastructure to scale. Canvas's "Clinic Plans" → "Builder Plans" → "Enterprise Plans" tiers match this growth trajectory. Fast implementation (weeks vs. months), developer control for product differentiation, but certified EMR infrastructure for compliance. Canvas customers (Patina, Carda, Fella) fit this profile: Series A/B digital health companies scaling.

**Initial Data Hypothesis:**
- **Crunchbase/Pitchbook**: Digital health companies raising Series A/B in past 12-24 months
  - Filter: Healthcare industry, $10M-$50M raised, seed→Series A or A→Series B transition
  - Employee growth: 10-50 or 50-200 on LinkedIn (indicates scaling)
- **LinkedIn Company Pages**: Track headcount growth rate (>50% increase in 12 months = scaling fast)
  - Job postings for: Clinical Operations, Clinicians (NP, PA, MD), Product Managers (indicates expanding programs)
- **Digital Health News**: Funding announcements from Rock Health, MobiHealthNews, Fierce Healthcare
- **AngelList/Wellfound**: Digital health job postings indicating scale (hiring multiple clinicians, ops leaders)
- **SEC Filings (Form D)**: Venture capital raises by private healthcare companies
- **App Store/Google Play**: Digital health apps with rapidly growing review volume (indicates patient growth)
